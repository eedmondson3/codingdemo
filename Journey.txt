This is my learning journey, I am documenting it to keep track
of my learning experience with becoming a data engineer. It is important 
to note that I do not have a CS degree or a background in Tech. I started
in tech as a learning and development specialist with a focus on 
Data Analytics. This will serve as excellent source material for others that
wish to learn all about big data, data analytics, and data engineering.
